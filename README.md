This was an attempt to make my own cd-key wholesale website while learning Django framework, which includes both the front-end and admin (django-admin and a separate back-end to upload contents in both image and txt formats).

I built this with Django, Django-admin, Nginx, PostgreSQL, Bootstrap and several other smaller components. There is some work to be done, specially on some business processes, but the application as it is features the following:

Product management via Django-admin
Digital goods uploading
Working shopping basket and checkout
Customer balance fully working
Stock management fully functional
Download of the goods working

I'm sorry, but this was done a few months ago so the instructions will be a little vague. Feel free to ask and I'll be glad to help you setting up your own website.
